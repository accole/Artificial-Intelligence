[a]  {x/A, y/A, z/B}
[b]  No Unification - A can't unify with B

[d]  {y/John, x/John}
[e]  No Unification - y can't unify with Father(y)

• John likes all kinds of food.
• Apples are food.
• Chicken is food.
• Anything someone eats and isn’t killed by is food.
• If you are killed by something, you are not alive.
• Bill eats peanuts and is still alive. *
• Sue eats everything Bill eats.  

[a]  (Ax)     food(x) => likes(John, x).
     	      food(Apples).
     	      food(Chicken).
     (Ax)(Ey) eats(y,x) ^ ~killed_by(y,x) => food(x).
     (Ax)(Ey) killed_by(y,x) => ~alive(y).
     	      eats(Bill,peanuts) ^ alive(Bill).
     (Ax)     eats(Bill,x) => eats(Sue,x).

[b]  (1)      ~food(x) v likes(John,x)
     (2)      food(Apples)
     (3)      food(Chicken)
     (4)      ~eats(y,x) v killed_by(y,x) v food(x)
     (5)      ~killed_by(y,x) v ~alive(y)
     (6)      eats(Bill,peanuts) ^ alive(Bill)
     (7)      ~eats(Bill,x) v eats(Sue,x)

[c]  In Clause (1): set likes(John,peanuts) = F
     With clause (5), alive(Bill) we resolve {y/Bill}
     Therefore ~killed_by(Bill,x) in (5)
     In (4), resolve {y/Bill, x/peanuts}
     Then killed_by(Bill,peanuts) v food(peanuts)
     
     Using above statements, resolve food(peanuts) = T, and then
     likes(John,peanuts) in Clause (1).
     
[d]  Clause (6) tells us eats(Bill,peanuts).
     Clause (7) tells us ~eats(Bill,peanuts) v eats(Sue,peanuts) 
     Therefore, eats(Sue,peanuts) = T.

[e]  First conver the replacement sentences

     • If you don’t eat, you die.
     • If you die, you are not alive.
     • Bill is alive. 

     (8)    eats(x,y) v dies(x)
     (9)    ~dies(x) v ~alive(x)
     (10)   alive(Bill)

     Using Clause (9) and (10), {x/Bill} and ~dies(Bill) = T
     Using (8), eats(Bill,y) =  T.
     Therefore, using (7) eats(Sue,y) = T.
     
     This is the most we can resolve the CNF Clauses since we do
     not have clauses that tell us what Bill, and therfore Sue, eats.

[a]  No, 3-coloring graph1.txt is unsatisfiable.
[b]  Yes, 4-coloring graph1.txt is satisfiable.
[c]  Since 3-coloring is unsatisfiable and 4-coloring is satisfiable,
     then 4 is the minimum number of colors needed to color each node
     a single color, with no nodes sharing an edge having the same color.
     A sample solution to this would be:
       Node 1:	 Red
       Node 2:	 Blue
       Node 3:	 Green
       Node 4:	 Blue
       Node 5:	 Yellow
       Node 6:	 Green
       Node 7:	 Yellow
[d]  8 Colors are required to properly color graph2.txt.
